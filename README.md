An AI App designed and implemented by Claude Sonnet 4 (with Extended Thinking feature switched on nearly the whole time), with some minimal prompting by Jeremy Carter, and intended to be run as a Claude.ai AI Artifact in the Artifacts Preview pane on https://claude.ai while having the AI Artifacts feature toggled on in your settings.

The app is currently entirely within this file: [./src/AICreativeStudio.tsx](./src/AICreativeStudio.tsx)
